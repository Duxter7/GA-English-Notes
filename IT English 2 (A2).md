I would like to have a console at home

So, you don't like videogames in general?

I played a little; I progressed a little 

**Does** he like to play videogames?
**Does** she study English?
**Do** we know him?

I **don't** like to speak with (to) Indians at work
He **doesn't** understand anything
My best friends **don't** want to do anything

I work every day and he work**s** every day too
For breakfast I have pizza, for breakfast he **has** pasta
