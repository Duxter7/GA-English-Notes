Do chores

Look through all my things

Children's birthday

I'm planning to run (jog)

Sheet - shit
Beach - bitch
Sheep - ship
Cheap - chip
Feel - fill

Going to go = going
	I'm going to swim tomorrow
	He's going to eat after the meeting
	I'm going to the store

I'm watching a new movie in the evening

I'm going to go to the office = I'm going to the office
